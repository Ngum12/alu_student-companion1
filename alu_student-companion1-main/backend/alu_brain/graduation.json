        "answer": "The Leadership Challenge is ALU's distinctive capstone project that all students must complete to graduate, regardless of their program of study. This culminating experience synthesizes your academic learning, leadership development, and practical skills into a meaningful impact project.\n\nThe Leadership Challenge has these key elements:\n\n1. Problem Identification: You identify a significant challenge affecting Africa or your local community related to your field of study. This could be in education, healthcare, technology, environmental sustainability, business, or another relevant sector.\n\n2. Research Phase: Conduct comprehensive research to understand the root causes, stakeholders, and existing approaches to addressing the challenge. This includes both academic research and fieldwork with affected communities.\n\n3. Solution Design: Develop an innovative, sustainable solution to address the identified challenge. Your solution must be practical, scalable, and demonstrate entrepreneurial thinking.\n\n4. Implementation: Execute a prototype or pilot of your solution in the real world. This implementation phase typically lasts 3-6 months and involves engagement with actual stakeholders and beneficiaries.\n\n5. Impact Assessment: Measure and analyze the outcomes of your implementation, identifying both successes and areas for improvement. Develop recommendations for future scaling or iteration of your solution.\n\n6. Documentation and Presentation: Produce a comprehensive written report and deliver a final presentation to a panel of faculty, external experts, and community members.\n\nThe Leadership Challenge begins in your penultimate term and continues through your final term. You'll be assigned a faculty advisor and potentially an industry mentor to guide your project. All Leadership Challenge projects must demonstrate ALU's core values of entrepreneurial leadership, ethical impact, and solution-oriented thinking.\n\nExemplary Leadership Challenge projects are showcased at ALU's annual Innovation Exhibition and may receive support for continued development beyond graduation."

        "question": "What is the distinction between graduation and commencement?",
        "answer": "At ALU, \"graduation\" and \"commencement\" refer to different aspects of the degree completion process. Graduation is the official act of conferring a degree upon a student who has successfully completed all academic requirements. This is an administrative process that involves final verification of credits, GPA, and other requirements, resulting in the official awarding of a degree that appears on your transcript. Graduation occurs when all requirements are certified as complete, regardless of participation in any ceremony.\n\nCommencement, on the other hand, refers to the formal ceremony celebrating this achievement. It's a ceremonial event where graduates wear academic regalia, are individually recognized, and symbolically receive their degrees through the presentation of diploma covers. The commencement ceremony includes traditions such as the processional, speeches, turning of tassels, and recessional.\n\nImportantly, participation in the commencement ceremony does not automatically mean a student has graduated. Some students who participate in commencement may have pending requirements to complete before their degree is officially conferred. Conversely, students who have officially graduated may choose not to attend commencement, graduating in absentia.\n\nOn official documentation, the graduation date reflects when degree requirements were completed and verified, not the date of the commencement ceremony.",

        "question": "How many guests can attend the graduation ceremony?",
        "answer": "Each graduate at ALU is guaranteed four free guest tickets to the commencement ceremony. These tickets are allocated on a first-come, first-served basis during the graduation application process. If you need additional tickets, you can request up to two extra tickets for $25 each, subject to availability. These additional tickets must be requested at least four weeks before the ceremony. For family members or friends who cannot attend in person, ALU provides a free livestream of the entire ceremony accessible through the university website and YouTube channel. The ceremony is also recorded and made available for later viewing. For guests requiring special accommodations (wheelchair access, sign language interpretation, etc.), graduates should indicate these needs during the ticket reservation process. While the main ceremony has limited seating, many of the departmental celebrations afterward have more flexible guest policies. International guests who need visa support letters can request these through the International Student Office at least two months before the ceremony.",
        "note": "Due to venue capacity constraints, guest tickets cannot be guaranteed beyond the standard allocation, so early requests are recommended."

        "question": "How should I prepare for the Leadership Challenge capstone project?",
        "answer": "Preparing for your Leadership Challenge capstone project should begin well before your final year at ALU. Here's a comprehensive preparation strategy:\n\n1. Early Exploration (Years 1-2):\n   - Pay attention to challenges and opportunities mentioned in your courses that spark your interest\n   - Join student organizations and initiatives related to potential challenge areas\n   - Begin building relationships with faculty members who could serve as advisors\n   - Use course assignments to explore potential challenge areas when possible\n   - Start a digital folder collecting articles, research, and ideas related to your interests\n\n2. Pre-Capstone Preparation (Year 3):\n   - Attend the Leadership Challenge information sessions in your junior year\n   - Complete the Leadership Challenge Preparation course (LEAD 301)\n   - Conduct preliminary research into 2-3 potential challenge areas\n   - Speak with alumni who completed successful Leadership Challenge projects\n   - Connect with community partners or organizations working in your area of interest\n   - Develop research and project management skills through relevant coursework\n   - Consider using your second Mission/internship to explore your challenge area\n\n3. Proposal Development (Beginning of Final Year):\n   - Register for the Leadership Challenge Seminar (LEAD 401)\n   - Develop a clear problem statement focusing on a specific aspect of your chosen challenge\n   - Conduct a thorough literature review and background research\n   - Identify key stakeholders and plan for engagement with affected communities\n   - Create a detailed project timeline with specific milestones and deliverables\n   - Form an advisory team including your faculty advisor and relevant external mentors\n   - Draft and submit your Leadership Challenge proposal for approval\n\n4. Implementation Preparation:\n   - Secure any necessary resources, partnerships, or funding\n   - Develop data collection instruments and evaluation metrics\n   - Complete any required ethics reviews or permissions\n   - Create contingency plans for potential obstacles\n   - Build a support team of peers, community members, and experts\n   - Establish regular check-in schedules with your advisor\n\n5. Documentation Planning:\n   - Set up systems for documenting your process from the beginning\n   - Plan how you'll capture both quantitative and qualitative outcomes\n   - Consider how you'll present your work (video, presentation, report format)\n   - Schedule regular reflection sessions to capture insights throughout the process\n\nThe most successful Leadership Challenge projects typically address genuine needs identified in collaboration with affected communities, have clear and measurable objectives, demonstrate innovation in approach, and show potential for sustainability beyond the project timeframe. Start early, be flexible as you learn and iterate, and focus on creating meaningful impact rather than simply completing a requirement."

        "question": "What is the deadline for completing graduation requirements?",
        "answer": "All academic requirements for graduation must be completed by the following deadlines:\n\n1. For Spring Term Graduates (May/June Ceremony):\n   - All coursework, including final exams: Last day of the Spring examination period\n   - Leadership Challenge final presentations: Two weeks before the end of Spring term\n   - Program-specific capstone projects: Deadlines set by individual departments, typically 3-4 weeks before term end\n   - Community service hours documentation: Four weeks before graduation\n   - Financial clearance: Two weeks before graduation\n\n2. For Fall Term Graduates (December Ceremony):\n   - All coursework, including final exams: Last day of the Fall examination period\n   - Leadership Challenge final presentations: Two weeks before the end of Fall term\n   - Program-specific capstone projects: Deadlines set by individual departments, typically 3-4 weeks before term end\n   - Community service hours documentation: Four weeks before graduation\n   - Financial clearance: Two weeks before graduation\n\nFaculty must submit final grades for graduating students within 72 hours of final assessments to allow time for degree certification. Any incomplete grades must be resolved by these deadlines. Extensions are rarely granted and require exceptional circumstances with documentation and approval from both the department chair and Dean of Academic Affairs.\n\nStudents who miss these deadlines will have their graduation deferred to the next term when all requirements are complete. However, those who are within 6 credits of completion may participate in the ceremony though their degrees will not be conferred until all requirements are met.",
        "note": "These deadlines are strictly enforced to ensure proper degree certification before commencement."
