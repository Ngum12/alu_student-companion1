Early communication can prevent late fees and registration holds.\n\n2. **Grace Period**: A 14-day grace period applies after the payment deadline during which no late fees are assessed.\n\n3. **Late Payment Fee**: After the grace period, a 5% late fee is applied to the outstanding balance.\n\n4. **Payment Plan Modification**: Students with existing payment plans may request a one-time modification per academic year without penalty.\n\n5. **Emergency Financial Assistance**: The university maintains a limited emergency fund for students facing unexpected financial hardship. Applications are reviewed on a case-by-case basis.\n\n6. **Academic Hold**: If payment is not received within 30 days of the due date, an academic hold may be placed on your account, preventing registration for future courses and access to official transcripts.\n\n7. **Installment Options**: In cases of financial difficulty, the Finance Office may approve breaking a single payment into smaller installments over a short period.\n\nThe university is committed to working with students facing genuine financial difficulties, but it's essential to be proactive and communicate with the Finance Office before missing payment deadlines."

      "question": "How do student loans work at ALU?",
      "answer": "ALU has established partnerships with several financial institutions to provide student loan options:\n\n1. ALU Partner Loan Program: Through partnerships with regional banks including Bank of Kigali, KCB Bank, and Commercial Bank of Mauritius, students can access education loans with favorable terms. These loans feature interest rates 2-3% below standard personal loans, extended repayment periods (up to 10 years), and grace periods that extend six months after graduation.\n\n2. Income-Share Agreements (ISAs): For selected programs, ALU offers an innovative financing model where students pay no tuition upfront but agree to pay a fixed percentage of their income (typically 10-15%) for a set period after graduation (usually 3-5 years), but only when earning above a minimum threshold. This aligns the university's financial success with graduate outcomes.\n\n3. International Student Loan Program: For international students, ALU partners with global education finance providers that offer loans requiring no local collateral or co-signers from the host country.\n\n4. Government-Backed Loan Programs: Students from several African countries can access government student loan programs that have agreements with ALU, including the Higher Education Loans Board (Kenya), Student Financing Agency for Rwanda, and Ghana Student Loan Trust.\n\nThe application process for student loans requires:\n\n- Completion of ALU's financial aid application\n- Meeting with a financial counselor to determine appropriate loan amounts\n- Submission of required documentation to the lending partner\n- Loan counseling to ensure understanding of repayment obligations\n\nALU strongly encourages students to borrow responsibly and only take loans for essential educational expenses. The Financial Aid Office provides loan counseling and financial literacy workshops to help students manage their educational debt effectively."

      "answer": "Yes, ALU charges a late registration fee of $100 for students who register for courses after the official registration period ends. This fee is waived for new students in their first term and for students who have documented extenuating circumstances approved by the Academic Affairs Office. Payment of the late registration fee does not guarantee availability in desired courses, as many courses reach capacity during the regular registration period. Students facing challenges meeting registration deadlines should contact their academic advisor before the deadline to discuss options and potentially avoid the late fee."
