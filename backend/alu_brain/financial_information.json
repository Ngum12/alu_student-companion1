      "question": "What happens if I can't pay my tuition on time?",
      "answer": "If you're unable to make your tuition payment by the deadline, ALU has a structured process to address financial difficulties:\n\n1. **Early Communication**: Contact the Finance Office as soon as you anticipate payment issues. Early communication can prevent late fees and registration holds.\n\n2. **Grace Period**: A 14-day grace period applies after the payment deadline during which no late fees are assessed.\n\n3. **Late Payment Fee**: After the grace period, a 5% late fee is applied to the outstanding balance.\n\n4. **Payment Plan Modification**: Students with existing payment plans may request a one-time modification per academic year without penalty.\n\n5. **Emergency Financial Assistance**: The university maintains a limited emergency fund for students facing unexpected financial hardship. Applications are reviewed on a case-by-case basis.\n\n6. **Academic Hold**: If payment is not received within 30 days of the due date, an academic hold may be placed on your account, preventing registration for future courses and access to official transcripts.\n\n7. **Installment Options**: In cases of financial difficulty, the Finance Office may approve breaking a single payment into smaller installments over a short period.\n\nThe university is committed to working with students facing genuine financial difficulties, but it's essential to be proactive and communicate with the Finance Office before missing payment deadlines."
