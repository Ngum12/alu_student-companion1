          "content": "Thank you for your question. Here's what I found for you:\n\n## How does the ALU scholarship system work?\n\nALU is committed to making education accessible to talented students regardless of their financial background. The scholarship system at ALU works through a combination of merit-based and need-based financial aid.\n\nWhen students apply to ALU, they are automatically considered for merit scholarships based on their academic performance, leadership potential, and overall application strength. These scholarships can range from partial tuition coverage to full scholarships covering tuition, housing, and stipends.\n\nFor need-based financial aid, students must complete the financial aid application as part of their admission process. This requires submitting documentation about family income and financial circumstances. ALU then determines the level of financial support based on demonstrated need.\n\nALU also partners with various organizations, governments, and foundations to provide additional scholarship opportunities for specific demographics or countries. These partner scholarships often have their own application processes and criteria.\n\nAll scholarship recipients are expected to maintain good academic standing and contribute positively to the ALU community. Some scholarships may have specific requirements such as work-study components or service commitments after graduation.\n\n\n*Source: ALU Admissions*\n\n## How do I apply for on-campus housing?\n\nHow do I apply for on-campus housing?\n\nTo apply for on-campus housing at ALU:\n1. Log in to your student portal\n2. Navigate to the 'Housing' section\n3. Complete the housing application form\n4. Submit your housing preferences\n5. Pay the housing deposit to secure your spot\n6. Wait for confirmation from the housing office\n\n### Steps\n\n1. Log in to your student portal\n2. Navigate to the 'Housing' section\n3. Complete the housing application form\n4. Submit your housing preferences\n5. Pay the housing deposit to secure your spot\n6. Wait for confirmation from the housing office\n\n\n*Source: ALU Campus Life*\n\n## How does ALU prepare students for entrepreneurship?\n\nALU's approach to entrepreneurship preparation is multifaceted and integrated across the educational experience.\n\nThe curriculum incorporates entrepreneurial thinking from day one, with all students completing courses in entrepreneurial leadership regardless of their major. These courses teach opportunity identification, design thinking, resource mobilization, and sustainable business modeling.\n\nBeyond the classroom, ALU offers several structured entrepreneurship programs:\n\n1. **Venture Incubator**: A semester-long program where student teams develop business ideas with mentorship from established entrepreneurs. Teams receive seed funding, workspace, and connection to potential investors.\n\n2. **Entrepreneurship Lab**: A dedicated space on campus equipped with prototyping tools, meeting rooms, and resources for business development. The Lab hosts regular workshops, pitch competitions, and networking events.\n\n3. **Founder's Mentorship Program**: Matches aspiring student entrepreneurs with successful founders for one-on-one mentorship throughout their ALU journey.\n\n4. **Innovation Challenges**: Regular competitions where students solve real business problems posed by industry partners, with winning solutions receiving implementation funding.\n\nALU also maintains partnerships with entrepreneurship ecosystems across Africa, providing students with internship opportunities at startups and access to accelerator programs post-graduation. Financial resources include the ALU Venture Fund, which provides early-stage capital to promising student and alumni ventures.\n\nThis comprehensive approach has resulted in approximately 15% of ALU graduates launching their own ventures within two years of graduation, with several raising significant external funding.\n\n\n*Source: ALU Career Services*\n\nI hope this information helps.
