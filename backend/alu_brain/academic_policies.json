Regular attendance is strongly correlated with academic success and is considered essential for the collaborative learning environment ALU fosters.\n\n**Excused Absences**\nExcused absences include:\n- Documented medical illness or emergency (requires healthcare provider documentation)\n- Religious observances (must be communicated to instructors in first week of class)\n- University-sponsored activities like athletic competitions or academic conferences (requires official documentation)\n- Family emergencies (requires dean's office notification)\n\n**Absence Limits**\nFor most courses, students are permitted:\n- For courses meeting 1-2 times per week: Maximum of 2 unexcused absences\n- For courses meeting 3 or more times per week: Maximum of 4 unexcused absences\n\nExceeding these limits may result in course grade penalties or course failure, at the instructor's discretion as specified in the syllabus.\n\n**Reporting Absences**\nStudents must notify instructors before class whenever possible, and submit any required documentation within 3 days of returning to class.\n\n**Make-up Work**\nStudents with excused absences are responsible for arranging to make up missed work directly with instructors. The format and deadline for make-up work is at the instructor's discretion but must provide a reasonable opportunity for students to demonstrate mastery.\n\n**Extended Absences**\nAbsences extending beyond one week require notification of the Dean of Students office, which will coordinate with instructors across all courses."
