      "answer": "ALU's approach to entrepreneurship preparation is multifaceted and integrated across the educational experience.\n\nThe curriculum incorporates entrepreneurial thinking from day one, with all students completing courses in entrepreneurial leadership regardless of their major. These courses teach opportunity identification, design thinking, resource mobilization, and sustainable business modeling.\n\nBeyond the classroom, ALU offers several structured entrepreneurship programs:\n\n1. **Venture Incubator**: A semester-long program where student teams develop business ideas with mentorship from established entrepreneurs. Teams receive seed funding, workspace, and connection to potential investors.\n\n2. **Entrepreneurship Lab**: A dedicated space on campus equipped with prototyping tools, meeting rooms, and resources for business development. The Lab hosts regular workshops, pitch competitions, and networking events.\n\n3. **Founder's Mentorship Program**: Matches aspiring student entrepreneurs with successful founders for one-on-one mentorship throughout their ALU journey.\n\n4. **Innovation Challenges**: Regular competitions where students solve real business problems posed by industry partners, with winning solutions receiving implementation funding.\n\nALU also maintains partnerships with entrepreneurship ecosystems across Africa, providing students with internship opportunities at startups and access to accelerator programs post-graduation. Financial resources include the ALU Venture Fund, which provides early-stage capital to promising student and alumni ventures.\n\nThis comprehensive approach has resulted in approximately 15% of ALU graduates launching their own ventures within two years of graduation, with several raising significant external funding."
