      "question": "How does the ALU scholarship system work?",
      "answer": "ALU is committed to making education accessible to talented students regardless of their financial background. The scholarship system at ALU works through a combination of merit-based and need-based financial aid.\n\nWhen students apply to ALU, they are automatically considered for merit scholarships based on their academic performance, leadership potential, and overall application strength. These scholarships can range from partial tuition coverage to full scholarships covering tuition, housing, and stipends.\n\nFor need-based financial aid, students must complete the financial aid application as part of their admission process. This requires submitting documentation about family income and financial circumstances. ALU then determines the level of financial support based on demonstrated need.\n\nALU also partners with various organizations, governments, and foundations to provide additional scholarship opportunities for specific demographics or countries. These partner scholarships often have their own application processes and criteria.\n\nAll scholarship recipients are expected to maintain good academic standing and contribute positively to the ALU community. Some scholarships may have specific requirements such as work-study components or service commitments after graduation."
